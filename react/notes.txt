Functional and class based components

React -> 2013 -> 

class based components -> widely -> 

		functional components -> werent powerfull -> (state) -> dumb components

FEb 2019 -> 
	class === functional -> 

	reasons 
	1) They are easy to use
	2) They involve writing less code
	3) For the people coming from different language to js, it becomes
	difficult for them to adopt the class based approach because js is veru
	different interms of this keyword. 

All the companies who had their codebase in class -> functioanl 

95% -> fucntioanl components 

Startup -> class based -> 
	1) migrate the code from class base to functional compoents
	2) 


If you have a UI based change, then your that particular variabel needs
to be a state. 
If it is not a UI change, its just a internal change  that is not meant to be 
displayed to the user then you wont be using states.

 Hooks -> 

 Statefull components and stateless components -> 
 	Components that have presence of state in them is called statefull,
 	and those who don't have any state defined in them they are called stateleess

 	Initally functioanl components werent that powerful -> functioanl
 	components -> 
 		func component -> could not create state before 

 		Hooks -> declare state


when we use setState (setCount) ->
1) updating the internal value of the count, 0 to 1
2) Updating the ui value of count again from 0 to 1, that happens with a 
process of rerendering 

1) the advantage of states is that it retains the value it is holding even
upon rerendering  but a normal variable will get reinitialized in that 
scenario

github pages -> static websites
react -> server

difference between state and prop -> 

1) we can also pass state as a prop ->


ddeployment ->
Todo Project -> 

Conditional Rendering ->
1) Through Ternary Operator 
2) && 
3) 


Tic Tac Toe -> 
1) reactstrap 
2) react-icons
3) conditional rendering 
4) child components, parent components 

px
em rem
%
responsive -> 

Desktop
Mobile -> 

CI CD -> Continuous Integration Continous Deployment -> 

1) prevState  -> (problems with setState) -> important -> 
2) forms in react
3) useref
4) uncontrolelr and controlled components

What kind of hooks you have used in react? 



units -> 

px ->
% ->
em -> 
rem -> root em
vw -> viewport width
vh -> viewport height

General Thumb ->
	font-size -> rem -> 99.5%
	Padding, margin ->em -> 95% 
	Width -> em, % (100%) or vw

	height: em, % (100%) or vh

body{
	margin:0px;
}
*{
	box-sizing: border-box;
}


imp properties flex ->

Parent level ->
	display: flex
	flex-direction:
	flex-wrap:
	align-items:
	justify-content

flex-direction -> row 
	justify-content => row => x axis
	align-items => column => y axis

flex-direction -> column 
	justify-content => column => y axis, parallel to the flex direction
	align-items => 90degrees with the flex direction

Child Level 
order
flex-grow
flex-shrink


what all we can do in css? 

style -> attributes? 
internal css 

what's the difference between 
how you work with directories -> 

./ -> means the current directory 
../ -> means the parent of the current directory


/ -> will talk some other day (this means the root of the current drive)

Absolute Path (not dependent)
-> Relative Path -> (in relation to someother path)


1) Tag selector 
2) ID Selector
3) Class Selector 



Things on my end
1) visibilikty hidden use cases
2) dispay none does it actually come on the dom tree.



amazon.in -> IP Address (192.168.0.2) -> data -> browser 

FRONTEND -> 

HTML -> Pillars or say raw structure of your house
CSS -> painting the house, marbelling the floor, 
JS -> Equipmetns, washing machine, light bulbb 

27th
	HTML Tags
		2 categories (interview )
		1) inline tags -> span, b, i, img, input
		2) block tags -> div, p, h1 - h6

		1) Paired tags <> </> -> div, span, h1, 
		2) Self Closing tags < /> -> br, img
		3) Paired and self closing 
		4) unpaired tags -> <> 

	Chrome Web Tools (web tools)
		Why to use vs code and chrome

	Attributes 
		Attributes give additional information about a tag 
		Compulsory
		Optional 

	Boilerplate  what does it indicate 
	10-12 Tags
	Paired and unpaired
	File structure

	1) DNS -> Done -> what happens when someone enters a url in browser
	2) Client server model -> done -> we related it to the url example
	2) Meta -> done -> 3 major things in meta -> 
	3) White Space collapsing  -> done -> br, &nbsp, &emsp, 
	
	4) Images -> 
		Attributes -> height, width, alt, src 
	5) File Structure -> absolute vs relative path -> 


		Addition of images 
		1) FIle  ->
		2) Url  -> 
	5) Assignment in class

	7) What should we prefer in absolute vs relative
	6) Audio, video 


	./ -> coming outside the file
	../ -> 1 directory or folder up
	../../ -> 2 directory up
	../../../ -> 3 directory up



Ip address -> IPv4 IPv6

jpg
jpeg
png
webp
gif

svg -> 


figure 
figcaption

1) when to use absolute and when to use relative path
2) 

audio
video 
	assignment ->


iframe -> 
	can any webpage in the internet be allowed to put on our website? -> done

Breakdown of a website -> DOne

Semantic HTML -> 

//Alternative to div ->
//certain meaning -> certain represenation ->  HTML 5

aside  ---->>> sidebar -> 
footer
header 

section -> often -> 
article ->

main ->>>
nav

many more 


Aria Attributes ->
All region internet access 



Tables -> 
	rowspan -> 
	colspan ->

thead and tbody -> a bit in more depth -> DONE
description list ->  DONE
to combine rowspan and colspan ->  DONE 
extensions in vs code -> Done

class, id =>  attributes -> 

class -> .
id => #

in class assignemnts ->  DOne
a little discussion on some applications of tables -> DONE
git -> Small intro -> versioning tool -> 



css -> intro -> 
forms -> 

 
Untracked   ->>>>>> git add <filename> || git add . (. all the files)
Tracked but not committed  ->>>>>>>> git commit -m "some meaningful message"
Committed 

to push changes on to the remote -> online -> 

git status -> 

<input type ="text" />
type = "number"
type ="email"
type ="url"
type ="password"
type="file"
type ="date"
type ="color"
type = "radio"

validation?????


type ="range"


css ->  (waterfall)
three ways in which we can include the css -> 
	inline 
	internal 
	external (preferred)

inline why? 
internal? -> 

font-size -> 
font-weight -> 
border -> 1px solid red
color -> 
background-color || background

background-color
font-weight

camelCase 


selectors -> 
	Basic Selectors
		tag selector (most basic selector)
		id selector -> # -> JS
		class selector -> . -> JS

specificity of inline css > internal || external

id vs class
id => identification (unique)
class => 

specificity -> id vs class vs tag

id > class > tag

some more selector -> 
attribute selector  -> title, href -> 
regex 

and more 

border || margin || padding - vvvimportant

CSS Units 

px -> 
em
rem
%
vh
vw

em tag vs em as a css unit

colors: RGB, HEX, HSL, 

rgb(100, 10, 255) => opacity, understanding 

0-255

rgba -> opacity -> 



display - vvv important
display: 
	block
	inline
	inline-block
	none

padding-top, padding-bottom, margin-top, margin-bottom with inline elements
block elements

display
inline 
	1) you cannot use height and width
	2) it takes onlt the content worth width and height
	3) you cannot use margin, padding top and bottom
block
	1) you can define height and width
	2) by default it has 100% width and 0px height
	3) you can use all margin and padding

inline-block 
none 
difference between display none and visibility: hidden (extreemely important
interview question as well as on a concept and application level)

Psuedo Classes -> 7 
at the time of interacting with the element
we are targetting some specific behaviour of the elements

:hover -> 

:active
:focus

:visited

:focus-

CSS combinators -> 

h1, h2, h3{
	
}
*{
	
}
element/tag , id and class ->
attribute selector -> 

Descendent Selector ( ) -> parent children
	element/id/class(parent) [space] element/id/class (child) any grand{

	}
	specificity -> 

	DOM -> Document Object Model -> 

Child Selector (>) -> parent > child (1st nesting) -> parent children

Adjacent Selector (+) ->  sibling relationship 

General Siblings Selector -> (~)

Psuedo Elements -> 
	a part of an element ->m
	list -> bullet points -> supporting content
	first-letter
	first-line

	most important (interview)
	::after
	::before

	::first-letter
	::first-line

	::marker
	::selection
	::placeholder

nth selector 

border: 1px solid red;
border-color:
border-width: 
border-type:


	div -> width 500px
			padding - 10px
			border 2px
			margin - 5px
	box sizing -> border-box

	What is the value of content-width based on the above css?


21st May 
	Box-sizing - ( important - )
	width, border, padding
		content-box -> default -> 
		border-box ->

	Background - 

	text-align:

	Flexbox - (vvv important) 

	display: flex;

	Parent Properties of flex ->

	display: flex;
	flex-direction: row; column;

	justify-content:
		space-between
		space-around
		space-evenly
		flex-start
		center

		
		flex-end

	align-items:
	

	flex-wrap


	align-content -> dependent (whether flex-wrap: wrap)



	how to center a div? vertically and horizontally

	Child Properties in flexbox ->

	1) Order

minmax() ->

if -> targetting -> desktop first -> 
	base css -> for desktop
	on media query -> handle smaller viewporrs/ devices
	-> max-width

if -> targeting -> mobile first ->
	base css -> for mobile 
	on media query -> handle bigger viewports/ devices
	-> min-width 

1 June ->
Bootstrap -> 

what is bootstrap? CSS and JS -> Framework or library ?

1) Speeds up your code writing -> 
2) Bootstrap -> Responsive Layout -> 
	Grid Model -> Responsiveness ->

Material Design -> 
Chakra UI ->

Tailwind -> utility classes ->

Some Disclaimers ->

	border-box and content-box? 



	Display , -> done

	x= 260


	200 = content-width + 10 +10 + 20 + 20
	content-width = 140;
	content-box ->
		content-width = 200, border:10, padding: 20 


	border-box 
		the width that we define that is the element width (not the content

	display  , when we use flex (justify-content), align items

	display: flex

	display: inline, inlin-block, block



	main axis -> justify content
	opposite axis -> align items

	flex direction -> row ( i.e main axis is X) ->

LiveScript -> 
JS -> Javascript?
December 4 1995 -> Brendan -> 

why?
Java popular -> 
Javascipt -> 

Javascript -> Nodejs, denojs 

wordpress -> 

Js -> 
use js 

JS -> learning how js works 

JS -> frontned -> html css alonf with js

JS -> as a frontend framework -> react

JS -> as a backend tech -> node

How to connect js to html?


Javascript ->
Java -> 
Java vs Javascript -> 

1) JS is a dynamically typed language-> 
	JAVA -> 
		int var1 = 10;
		char abcd = 'a';

		var1 = 'abcd'; //error

	var 

	whereas Java is a strictly typed language

2) Twice declaration || redeclaration of the same variable
	
	int var1 = 10;
	int var1 = 20;

	JS ->
		var var1 = 10;
		var var1 = 20; //this var 

	var ->

3) we can output the variable or we can have access to variable before 
even the declaration

	Java -> will throw me an error

	Javascript -> it won't throw me an error it will give me undefined


Reserved keywords ->
let
var
class
this

4) Not Usage of semicolon wont throw me any error in js
	
	java -> error
	js -> no error -> but -> it is recommended to add semicolons -> 

5) JS is a functional language, Java, c++ -> Object oriented language
	IN JS there is no fundametal concept of class 

6) Js is a high level language, Java, c++ etc are low level language

if
for
while
ternary operator
||
&&
switch

function  


high level langauges ->
low level language 
assembly level languages -> most difficult to write but have the maximum 
control and efficienncy -> 
hardware 

4 lines of code in js -> 40 lines of code in c++

Js -> 
Js is a single threaded non blocking asynchronous concurrent language.

JS -> data types in js 

1) Primitive Data types
	A) number
	B) Boolean
	C) String
	D) null
	5) undefined

	memory allocation or not

	7) Big Int
	6) symbol -> not that imporant 

2) Non Primitive Data types
	A) Array -> []
	B) Objects -> {}

	C) Date - important 

	and a few more


Combining Data types in JS -> 

string + number => 'a' + 4 + 'b' => 'a4b'


					'1' + 4 => '14'

NaN -> Not a number -> type of (NaN) => number => 

operators -> 
*
>
<
+
-
%
\

condition ? true : false => 
== => double euivalency => comparision of the value
!=

=== => triple equivalency -> comparision of data type along with the value
!==

implicit conversion -> coercision ->

data type -> 

str == num -> it does this type conversion -> implicitely -> on its own

parseInt(str) -> conversion -> explicit conversion -> i am doing intentionally



var str = '10' => datatype is string

var numb = 10; => datatype is number 

when I do something like 

str == numb => how internally it is getting executed

------>   parseInt(str) => compare str and numb -> integer 10 and integer 10
===> true

str === numb => max times you will be preferring === over ==
======> false


Falsy and truthy values -> 

false -> booleans
true -> booleans 

Falsy values ->
	1) 0
	2) NaN
	3) undefined
	4) null
	5) ''

	if your variables are getting computed to any of the above valeus 
	they will be sort of considered as false.


Execution Context ->
	memory allocation pahse & code execution phase -> 

	single threaded ->
Functions -> 
	normal functions
	functions expression
		var funcVariable = function abcd(){
			console.log('something')
		}
		abcd() -> this is wrong -> error
		funcVariable()



Execution Context -> 
	var and functions

	function expression -> variable -> variable rather functions
	var funcX = function abcd(){

	}

Hoisting -> The phenomenon where we are able to get the value undefined 
for the variables which are yet to be declared that is basically your hoisting -> 

	1) variable declaratio are scanned and made undefined
	2) function declarations(normal functiosns) are scanned and made avaiable ->

Scope and scope chain -> 

22nd June

Scope -> more illustrations
Questions on scope, execution context and hoisting -> var

Basic about objects -> basics 

Dealing with strings ->



In Class questions - all remaining

Quiz 


Algorithm -> 
	1) Execution context gets pushed to the stack
	2) Memory allocation phase happens (js doesnt care what is going on
	in the code)
	3) Code Execution happens line by line



Some basics around programming -> binary operators and operator
precedence -> done

Scope Questions -> more
Lexical Environments -> done ->

IIFE -> Instantaneoulsy Invoked Function Expression

Arrow Functions, 
callback, 
first class functions and 
high class functions


First Class Functions and High class function 
first order function and high order function


try catch

-> predefined errors -> 
	Error
	TypeError
	ReferenceError
	RangeError
	SyntaxError

-> custom errors as well -> 
	How? not required right now 


let and const -> 
scoping of let and const  ->


var vs let vs const 
1) declarations and initilizations
2) scoping 

let and cosnt have block scope whereas the var has function scope
{
	
}

var a = 5;
function (){
	//var a = 10;
	console.log(a) //10
}
console.log(a) //5

function scope vs block scope -> 

in case of let and const we cannot have the same declarations of it
in the same scope. 
If they are in differnt scope they will act as a different variable
like the same way we had a "var" in global and a function.


Alternate
we cannot have 2 same variable if one of them is let or const declaration in same scope

loops -> 
for()



hoisting in let and const -> 
temporal dead zone -> 
impact of let and const on execution context ->
questions based on let and const -> 

hoisting even happens in let and const.

JS -> 
1) Can access elements 
2) It can change the content of the elements
3) we can add style (inline css ) to the elements through JS
4) Dealing with classes -> adding, removing

window -> global object 

window -> 
		console
		document
		location -> pathname, complete url name, port, protocol
			to switch html pages -> 

		setTimeout -> 
		setInterval ->

		localStorage
		sessionStorage
		and many more things that we will see later on



you have 2 buttons on the webpage, 
the first button should have its color as red immediatelly when we 
execcute the js
the second button should have its background color as green after 
4seconds.

1) create 2 buttons on html 
2) selector of buttons 
3) change color of first
4) change bg color of second in a setTimeout

-----------------------------
Events -> extremely important 

How to select -> select attributes
How to add -> attributes through js

In class questions ->
-----------------------------

click -> 

dblclick -> 
focus -> 
blur ->
scroll -> 
keyup / keydown / keypress -> 
change -> 
mouseover  ->
mouseenter ->
mousexit -> 

Register -> addEventListener ->  (** the one you have to use)
onclick  -> html end
selectedELement.onclick -> js end


Separation of Concerns -> 

I don't want the js to be present with my html code ->

why? 
readibility ->
easeiness of finding things -> 

not interlink -> 

//hwo to get a vlaue from the input box -> 

You have two input boxes -> 
both input box accepts number ->

There is a button called as sum ->

Once the user clicks on the button -> On the consoled I want the added 
sum of of the input boxes.

Points to take care of:-
1) If the input box is empty, you should not display any sum
rather you should print on console that please provide all inputs
2) once sum has been succesfully calculated the input box should be 
empty



event -> 

form -> 'submit' ->default functionality -> redicerts and submits form
information and refreshes -> forms->

button -> 'click' -> 

a -> href -> redirects to the url -> default 


dragover -> not to be dragged -> 



user submits the form -> capture response -> store in obj ->
print ovj -> inside the displayArea show the values of the user ->

event capturing and bubbling -> 


events are a very expensive operation -> 
why expensive? we will discuss later -> 
That we should apply events judiciously -> 

1) output questions based on event listeners -> propagation
2) immediateStopPropagation()
3) event delegation ->  question based on event delegation

4) DOM level 2 -> 
	Creation of html nodes -> 


-> formData -> 
	docuemnt.querySelector()


formda
API -> new formData() -> form -> 

internal storage in browsers
localstorage
sessionstorage
cookies 


5) Level 3 -> formdata()
creating your own events 
dispatching your custom events 
dispatching the events already present



->
calculator -> should not work with mouse ->
everythign should be handled with keyboard -> 

only the place where you want to enter the value can be clicked 
rest whole claculator should be operated with the keyboard itself 


keyboard -> \ -> on the entire screen -> you will place the cursor
at the input area -> 









stopPropagation -> 
child and parent -> events propgatin ->



immediateStopPropagation -> superSet of stopPropgation ->

stopProgation + it even blocks the other events on the same level


(obj['key'] === obj.key) != obj[key]

	User inputs a value -> click on the create task button ->
	the value gets appended to a box ->

	Now the way this todo is getting added -> 
	within this todo -> there should be

	1) Remove button -> when the user clicks on the remove button
	the todolist should be removed
	2) ofcourse the user data -> 
	3) Optional -> there is another button -> Mark Important ->
	when the user clicks this button for the first time -> 
	the entire background of that todo becomes yellow 
	when the user clicks that button again the yellow background 
	gets removed 
	(Hint: to solve optional -> use classlist.toggle())

to use localstorage to handle the list -> (not to be btohered)

TODO List -> React, -> with multiple other things ->


LocalStorage Vs Session Storage Vs Cookies -> 

All these are browser storage ->
Basically if you temprarily wanna store something on to the clients
 end4

 LocalStorage -> whatever information you store in localstorage 
 it remains there permanently unless and untill you delete it by going 
 in the chrome web tools and deleting it or through code.

 basically -> local storage isnt automatically deleted by browser ->
 you need a manual triggger to delete it.


 CRUD -> create read update delete

 //create
localStorage.setItem('name', 'naman');
localStorage.setItem('age', '10');

//update -> manipulating an existing key
localStorage.setItem('name', 'new valuie')


//read
const newName = localStorage.getItem('name');
console.log(newName);

//delete
localStorage.removeItem('name');


localstorage -> 
stores things in string format -> 

JSON -> Javascript Object Notation

Whenever we are communicating we need a certain format for that 
communication 
and that format is JSON

Json is not kjsut used for communication -> it is also used for storage


to convert JS object to JSON -> use -> JSON.stringify(<JS_object>)
to convert JSON to JS Object -> use -> JSON.parse(<JSON>)


Session Storage -> 
session storage -> can get automatically removed by the browser on 
closure of a tab/ browser

the manual ways that we had in local storage is also present in 
session storage -> 

Localstorage and session storage have storage value in MB 
session storage -> 5MB, Local storage -> >5MB

Cookies -> 
1KB -> 

Why we need cookies -> 


Next Lecture ->
COmplete TODO application by integrating local storage -> 
Another application -> making a toast -> very good question ->
CLass assignemnts ->

Homework -> to attemot the class assignemtns ->
			Revision 

Fundamentals -> 

Next Leccture ->
JS again -> THIS keyword ->



whenever we are adding a certain task -> that should also be appended
in my localstorage -> push() object after creating the object-> in the existing key;

when the user clicks  on delete button -> we need to update the existing localstorage where we delte that particular todo.

get the todos from the localstorage and make html elements for that.


Homework -> 
Thursday -> 

TOAST Generator ->  HTML , CSS and JS -> 
positions -> 
flexbox -> 
JS -> todo -> toast -> 


Toast -> 
1) HTML CSS -> Toast Customization
2) HTML CSS -> Toast Message -> demo -> 
(later on this will be done in js)
but as you need proper classes etc thats why you will make a 
demo in html css
positions -> absolute -> right -> 10px, top -> 10px
flexbox -> toastMessageContaienr -> 
flexp-column -> column -> gap -> 

.prepend ->
append -> 

creatign a toast -> creating a todo ->
delete  button -> todo -> cross on toast -> 

all of the toast customization	
	1)green/ red 

3) Select all the values given in the toast customization
4) attahc event lsitener on add buttton -> toast message 

5) isCancelled and success and error -> conditional css  

6) handling the duration -> setTimeout -> 

7) Clear all toast -> 

Base Code ->

Bonuses ->

1) Error Handling -> user didnt put a certain value -> 
show alert -> you need this this this 

2) By having defualts set in the js ->

Js -> success -> 
DUration -> 3000 ms

3) Setting defaults at client level -> form -> 
because -> user can remove those values -> 


THIS -> 
Default function -> function () -> 1st Category ->
4 kinds of sitautions -> 

Very Important ->
the value of this in default functions is not dependent where the this is present, it is dependent on how we are calling the function -> 


Default Binding -> done
Implicit  -> done

Next Lecture ->
	Explicit -> call, bind and apply -> 

	bind -> it does not call the function, it returns a reference in which our provided this is binded with that function. 

	new keyword 

Arrow Function -> 2nd category ->

JS doesnt have any concept of classes internally ->
There is a keyword class present in JS but that is just sugarcoat
internally we have something called as a constructor function ->

constructor function is just a special form of a function
how special? 
Constructor functions are invoked with new keyword

New Keywords -> Roles and Responsibilites -> 

/*  
    1) it creates a empty object -> {}
    2) it points the value of this to the empty object it created 
    this = {}
    3) if we are not returning anything from the constructor function or if we are not returning a object it automatically returns this keyword.
    4) 
*/ 

questions based on functional this 
concept on arrow functions -> this 


the value of this in default functions is not dependent where the this is present, it is dependent on how we are calling the function ->

arrow function are totally opposite of it -> 
the value of this in arrow functions is depenednt on where the arrow functions are present. It does not matter how we are calling it.  


arrow func vs normal functions ->
arrow functions do not have a binding with this -> they do not contain any this value of themselves 

normal functiosn -> they have their own this value which is detemmined by how we are calling the funciton

closure ->

If we are waiting for the backend to give me the data ->
at that point what will happen to our website in terms of interaction.

what if JS couldnt handle things asynchronously? 
user will get stuck -> 
in what terms???

Events -> 
Scroll events -> 
Animations -> JS 
any data we have to bring -> 

Facebook -> 
chatting -> you are not able to receive chats
Facebook feed -> 


WEB APIS ->

timing functions 
setTimeout
setInterval

Dom -> 
.textContent
.innerHtml
.innerText

fetch -> all api calls 

drag drop 








console.log('start')
setTimeout(()=>{
    console.log('mid')
},1000)
console.log('endd')


does setTimeout gets exxecuted exactly in the time we provided? 


Event loop -> done
APi part 1 -> done
Event and event loop relation -> done


//Question1 ->

1) when does a promise return?
2) when does the state of promise becomes fulfilled?
3) when does the state of promise becomes rejected?
4) when does my promise call .then's callback? if state fulfills ->
automatically it calls .then(cb())
5) when does my promise call .catch's callbakc? when state has become -> rejected
6) when will my promise not call neither catch nor then?
	unless and until -> my promise state gets resolved or rejected
	till that point my promise is not obliged to call any of the .then
	callback or .catch callback

2 projects -> 


Async -> paradigm which helps us in handling our code concurrently. 

what if JS could not handle async approach? 

If i LOAD a page then already your html, css, js is read -> 
true or false?
true 

what options I have to interact with the page? 


backend code ->

//talk about timer -> 
const timer = setTimeout(()=>{
    console.log('abcd')
}, 1000)
clearTimeout(timer);

1) How to handle API
2) Through what the API communication happens 
3) Status code and different types of api calls 
3) How to use fetch to print the incoming data 
4) Promise Chaining ->


a lot of questions on api calling -> 


1) write a promise based function which gets resolved after 1000ms

2) upon resolving it send a object having "names" as the key and some children names as the values, print this object upon success of Promise.


5 methods of calling an API -> 
1) Get
2) Post
3) Put
4) Patch
5) Delete 

xyz.com/food -> API 
GET ->
POST -> ........




only object and arrays are considered as valid JSON type -> 


.json() -> is a promise based function -> which you have to put on the
data coming from the fetch to get the JS object ->

.then chaining ->
.catch -> 
API -> Get call 


1) Comparision of Promise with callbacks  (Imp - interview, code)
	A) Callback Hell Done
	B) Inversion of Control Done
2) Live Chaining API's calls  -> DONE
3) Mocking Chaining API's  -> DONE
6) Async Await -> Done
4) Assignemnts -> 
5) Fetch -> in more depth 
	/* Status code  */
	1XX
	2XX -> Success -> 200, 201
	3XX 
	4XX -> Client Side Error -> 404 (Not Found), 403 (Authentication Error)
	5XX -> Server Side Error -> 500 

When everything fine with api -> got correct response -> i.e 200
hence .ok === true and we did not go to the catch




7) Advanced functions of Promises -> Done
	A) Promise.all 
	B) Promise.race
	C) Promise.allSettled
	D) Promise.any
8) setInterval ->  Done
9) Async function working -> Done





Algo -> ipl assignemnt ->

Js ->
fetch -> .then -> data.json() -> data -> sort data on NRR -> 
display the table by running a for(for each) loop on each object ->

write css ->  


Fetch ->
	encounters -> 4xx -> 
				->doesnt reject -> 
				-> normal try block executes

	encounters	-> 5xx -> treat it as a threat
				-> executes Reject
				-> try cannot handle a reject
				-> transfers to catch 
				-> printed

Promise.all -> 
	this can be used to make a parallel request of APi
		->>> the important point to understand/ or check while calling api parallally is that, they should not be dependent on each other (They can be dependent on some past data that we already possess)
		->>Promise.all comes with certian -> gotcha points which are
		1) Promise.all resolution depends on the slowest API
		2) Even if one of the api in promise all fails(Rejects) -> then we can't know the status of the other API response

Promise.allSettled -> 


//resolve resolve, resolve reject, reject resolve
//async async -> done

DSA -> Frontend Developer -> JS () ->

ES6 File systems -> 
How to link 2 JS files???

import  -> when I am brining some other file onto my file
named export, default export ->

named import and export -> 
default import and export -> 
	1) In one file we can only have 1 function as a default export 


node modules -> 
Third party packages -> 

Recap -> 
	1) Named and default export import -> to utilise this
		A) type = module 
		B) Switch on a local server -> to avoid CORS error
		C) Import and export on two different js files

	2) NPM ->
		To utilise npm -> 
		A) Installed Node -> LTS version -> version 18.18
		B) verified npm and node -> npm -v , node -v => certain veriosn

		Three popular options ->.
		Parcel
		Webpack
		Vite

	3) To use Axios
		A) Did the Step 2
		B) npm i axios 
		C) Import axios we got error -> 404
		D) To fix above we require a module bundler -> Parcel
		E) npm i Parcel
		F) npx parcel index.html
		G) Able to utilise our axios and things are good 



linux commands -> utmost requirement of a software engineer

	cd -> change directory -> to navigate between folders
		cd <that fodler name> 
		cd ..
	pwd -> present work directory
	ls -> list
	mkdir -> make directory
	touch ->  make file
	rm -> remove 
	nano -> entering a file 
	rm -r -> deleted nested folders
	rm -rf -> deleted nested folders forcefully ->


Query param vs Path param
	/student/2 -> 2 is acting as path param 

	/student/:id/:partnerNumber ->
		/student/1/100
		/student/2/50

	/comments?postId=1 -> 
	/comments?postId=1&blogId=5 
		-> 
		/comments?postId=1&blogId=5 
		/comments?postId=2&blogId=3


/comments/post/:id -> {id}

/comment/:commentId/post/:postID

Fetch vs Axios
1) in case of post request, JSON.stringify not required -> 
2) axios returns us a custom axios object in which the data is present
in in custom axios object as a data key 
3) you dont have to do data.json() in axios, it automaticalls does that for you
4) error handling in axios for 4xx series is autmatically done by axios we don't have to do something like response.ok
5) Axios comes with certain more special functionalities one of them is interceptors  (we haven't discussed this)

Homework: 
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/

call the first 5 api in here with both axios and fetch -> 

Throttling -> 
I won't be restting the timer -> but no matter how many times you call the function that you have passed through the throttling function I will only execute it once.

1) Infinite Scrolling 
2) Pagination 
These are frontend techniques to display some large qty values ->

Our API structure -> looks something like ->

https://www.amazon.com/product?page=1&qty=10

These two are heavily used whenever we are dealign with data which is quite heavy in number. 

For instance -> 


Your API delay is dependent on ->
1) Server 
	1) How heavy computation is requireed for that request
	2) How much data that request is carrying
	3) Server Configuration

2) Network Congestion

REACT -> 
React is a js library to make frontend -> 

Vue ->
Angular ->
Svelte -> 

React -> developed by FACEBOOK ->
	it is maintained by facebook ->
	it is opensource -> other developers can also contribute and we can expand quickly -> 

	bootstrap -> twitter ->
	kafka -> (backend) -> linkedin 
	memecache -> 
	redis -> 

React 
React-DOM 

React Native ->

JS -> 

Current Version -> 

React + dependencies -> 

1) Webpack (bundler)
2) Babel -> transpielr -> react code to browser compatible code
+++++ a lot more -> 

There is a custom setup involved to perfectly use React -> 

Facebook Community -> We will create a template for you, you have to just type the command ->>

npx create-react-app <App_name> 

1) 

npm cache clean --force
npm cache verify
npm start --reset-cache

1) A blank HTML  -> body -> div (id = root)
2) From the JS file 
	A) YOu would need to select the div 
	C) create another  div
	D) content -> Hello React
	E) Append the newly created div into the starting div


1) Don't touch the DOM by yourself -> 
2) Build the website like LEGO blocks(components) ->

3 more points -> 

why we use React ->
1) It is very fast -> why? It uses something called as Virtual DOM -> 
2) A application build with react doesnt refresh most times -> better user experience -


1) JSX
2) Components 
3) Props
4) States 

Understnad diferenced between JSX and HTML -> 

1) You can uise inbuilt custom tags
2) You can use js inside the JSX in html you cannot 
3) It is compulsory for a JSX to have a closing tag 
4) Writing inline CSS in JSX is different from HTML 
5) IN JSX you can run a map as a loop, because jsx supports JS
	************* you cannot use normal for loops in JSX 
	Reason? I will tell later
6) we cannot use class syntax in jsx class is replaced by className

HTML -> inline css ->  style="font-size: 10px;"


TASK 
1) Build three components - Header, Main, Footer -> 
2) All three should render / return -> h1 with any random text
3) Header should be center aligned
4) Main should hhave background color as red
5) Footer should have color as green

80% -> 


Principles of React ->
1) Reusability 
2) Unidirectional Flow of Data -> from parent to child

React Codes
Link 1 -> https://code.newtonschool.co/newton-box/zi0tljypldvj/
Link 2 -> https://code.newtonschool.co/newton-box/j77vohz1z6sy/ 
(bootstrap conversion)
Link 3 -> https://code.newtonschool.co/newton-box/w0jqjh253bkm/
(Prop Discussion)


https://my.newtonschool.co/playgrounds
JSX is a abstraction over the real react api code -> 

Fragment -> done
Key ->  done
Conditional Rendering -> 

Virtual DOM -> React is considered to be very fast -> 
It uses somehting called as a Virtual DOM ->

??

Reconcillation -> 
Diffing ALgorithm ->



States ->

1) We initialise the state and this tells react that the variable for whom you defined the state can change during the course of the applciation
2) Whenever the count changes -> react has to repaitn the UI so that the user can see the updated value of the variable in the UI. 
3) You have to follow one more condition for react, you can't update the state variable on your own, you have to update it using the function that I provide.  


// onclick, btn.addEventListener('click')

EXtremely Important Point ->
Whenever you have to update the state update using the function

onClick -> 

Basics of states ->

we saw that if the parent state changes then the parent rerenders along with all the child that the parent had initialized

if we have aa state defined in the child, and we change that state in that scenario only the child and its child are rerendered, parent in that case don't get rerendered.

1) very small discussion about conditional rendering 
2) Assignemtns (react) ->
3) Understanding more around components and react history

Two Types -> Functional Components and Class based components ->
difference? Syntax

State things that we just did in the fucntional components, till 2016 we could not declare a state inside functional components. 
React 16 -> Functioanl Components started supporting state. 

Disclaimers -> ypu will aalwyas and always write a functional based component.

Why do we need to learn class based components? 
1) Interviews (Lifecycle)
2) YOu are given the task to migrate from class based to function based
3) Their are some external libraries out their which solely still uses class based syntax (so at times you might require to understand it)
4) around 3 months -> react released its new documentaiton which is primarily on functional components itself, the original react docuemntaiton contained a lot of concepts explained through class based components. Maybe you get so implementation on the internet rhoguh class based component which you might yourself convert to a functioanl based component  


4) Statefull and stateless components (dummy components)
The components which utilises states in them, those are statefull components. 

5) Dealing with state in other data types 


CSS ->
Conditional CSS -> 
Pre -> package.json, package-lock.json
3) Understanding external packages (reactstrap, toastisty, react-icons)
4) Mini project -> TIC TAC TOE -> 
5) Pure and impure Components



Package.json -> keeps a track of every pavckage that we insstalled along with the version

why do we need package.json?

Every package that we install from npmjs.com through the command npm i is bascially present on the internet. The packages that we install are very bulky. 

During the development we involve a lot of code push and pull, we don't want to slow our development process by pushing the same node_moduels which the user can find from the internet itself and hence we avoid pushing the node_modules code

suppose a user pulls in a codebase and wants the node_modules then he can run the command npm i

npm i will basically iterate over the package.json and install all the dependencies that the project holds. 

How do we tell the git not to push the node_modules? 
Answer -> By putting node_modules inside .gitignore 

why do we need to track the versions in package.json?4

package-lock.json? we have dependencies of depenedices tracks the versions of that as well. 
Ppackage-lock.json is a file that can be regenrated, but package.json is extermely cruical file. 

Replay -> 

we have to track the whole journey -> 
journey of correct moves -> 


3 packackes ->
React-Icons 
Toastify
Reactstrap -> (barely) -> component architecture



Understanding the libraries ->
reading documentations

explroign the doumentations of three libraries ->
and their usage ->

in the tic tac toe project we will be utilising all the lobratries tha twe studied today.
